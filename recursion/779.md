# LeetCode Problem 779: K-th Symbol in Grammar

## Problem Statement

On the first row, we write a `0`. Now in every subsequent row, we look at the previous row and replace each occurrence of `0` with `01`, and each occurrence of `1` with `10`.

- Given row `n` and index `k`, return the `k`-th (1-indexed) symbol in row `n`.

### Example:

```
Input: n = 4, k = 5
Output: 1
Explanation:
Row 1: 0
Row 2: 01
Row 3: 0110
Row 4: 01101001
The 5th symbol in the 4th row is 1.
```

## Approach

This is a recursive problem where:
- The first row is always `0`.
- For each row:
  - `0 -> 01`
  - `1 -> 10`
- The position of `k` in row `n` depends on its position in row `n-1`.

### Key Observations:
- If `k` is even, the result is the **opposite** of the `(k/2)`-th element in row `n-1`.
- If `k` is odd, the result is the **same** as the `(k/2 + 1)`-th element in row `n-1`.

## Code

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int kthGrammar(int n, int k) {
        if(n==1)return 0;
        if(k%2==0){
            //flip answer
           int x = kthGrammar(n-1, k/2);
           return x == 1 ? 0 : 1;
        }
        else { // k is odd
            // same answer
            return kthGrammar(n-1, (k/2) + 1);
        }
    }
};
```

## Time and Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`  
  - Because we recurse from `n` down to `1`, doing constant work at each step.

- **Space Complexity:** `O(n)`  
  - Due to the recursive call stack of depth `n`.
