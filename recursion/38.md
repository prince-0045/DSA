# Leetcode 38: Count and Say

## ðŸ§© Problem Statement

The **Count and Say** sequence is a sequence of digit strings defined by the recursive formula:

- `countAndSay(1)` = "1"
- `countAndSay(n)` is the **count-and-say** of `countAndSay(n - 1)`

To generate the next term, count the number of digits (say how many) in groups of the same digit from the previous term.

### Example:
```
1.     "1"
2.     "11"        (one 1)
3.     "21"        (two 1s)
4.     "1211"      (one 2, then one 1)
5.     "111221"    (one 1, one 2, two 1s)
```

## ðŸ“˜ Approach

- Use **recursion** to get the previous term `countAndSay(n-1)`.
- **Iterate** through that term, counting consecutive characters.
- Concatenate the count followed by the character to form the next term.

## ðŸ’» Code (C++)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string countAndSay(int n) {
        if(n == 1) return "1";
        
        string str = countAndSay(n - 1); // recursive call
        string ztr = "";
        int freq = 1;
        char ch = str[0];

        for(int i = 1; i < str.length(); i++) {
            char dh = str[i];
            if(ch == dh) {
                freq++;
            } else {
                ztr += (to_string(freq) + ch); // append frequency and digit
                freq = 1;
                ch = dh;
            }
        }
        // handle the last sequence
        ztr += (to_string(freq) + ch);

        return ztr;
    }
};
```

## ðŸ§  Time and Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(N Ã— M), where M is the length of the string at nth step (exponential growth).
- **Space Complexity:** O(M), for the output string.

## ðŸ§ª Sample Test Cases

| Input | Output    |
|-------|-----------|
| 1     | "1"       |
| 2     | "11"      |
| 3     | "21"      |
| 4     | "1211"    |
| 5     | "111221"  |

## ðŸ“Œ Notes

- Make sure to handle the **final group** after the loop (very common mistake).
- The recursive solution is elegant but can be rewritten iteratively for efficiency in languages without TCO (Tail Call Optimization).
